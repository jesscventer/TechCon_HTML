        <article> <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2001 as a small gathering of 42 tech enthusiasts in a local library. Our initial goal was to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration among emerging professionals. Sinc our humble beginnings we have grown into the premier event in Africa, and if we may say so - the world! Our conferences now attract attendees and speakers from over 100 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                TechCon always aims to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape, always striving to bring the most cutting-edge topics and influential voices to our audience.
